# Intro

- Ubiquitous computing was coined by Mark Weiser in 1988
  - computation using any devices, anywhere, and anytime
  - throughout the physical environment, while invisible to the user
- Mobile computing is a special form of ubiquitous computing and distributed computing

## Fundamental Challenges

These constraints are not artifacts of current technology, but intrinsic to mobility.

- Mobile devices will always be resource-poor relative too desktops
  - exacerbated further by the increasingly demanding application requirements
- Mobile connectivity can be highly variable in performance and reliable
  - Still an issue despite new tech such as 5G
  - Can be mitigated with client-server solutions such as Google's Firebase
- Finite battery to draw energy from
  - Despite battery technology advances
  - Emerging apps are increasingly power-hungry
- More prone to damage/loss than stationary computers
  - Cloud servers/storage

## Need for Adaption

- Relative resource constraints of mobile devices argue for reliance on static servers
- Unreliable network performance argues for self-reliance.
- Like all system designs, mobile computing must **balance** these competing concerns.
  
### Balance

- Leverage remote servers, often referred to as computation offloading
- Coping with variable mobile network
- Being aware of power consumption
- Such choices have to be made **dynamically** (it calls for adaptation!)
  
## Application Strategies

- **Laissez-faire** - let individual applications take cre of themselves
  - Benefits: more informed decisions and no reliance on system such as mobile OS support
  - Drawbacks: difficulty to resolve and enforce resource allocation for eah app, and dev. burdens on app developers.
- Somewhere in the middle is **application-aware**
- **Application-transparent** - let system handle all the responsibilities
  - Benefits: more compatible with applications that are not designed for mobile and can enforce fairness when allocating resources
  - Drawbacks: suboptimal decisions from individual applications' perspective

### Application Aware adaptation

- Androids sensor manager and applications' sensing preferences
  - *Sensor Manager*: manages the sampling frequency and collection from the hardware sensors, on behalf of applications
  - *Individual Applications*: define the type of sensors and levels of granularity
- Android activity manager and applications' activities
  - *Activity Manager*: manages the switch between foreground and background apps; ensures foreground app is responsive by killing background apps if necessary
    - As a result, we don't have much control over how our app is started. Users control when app is killed/ran
  - *Activities*: need to implement lifecycle callback functions and handle application states by saving and resting appropriately

## Other Challenges:

- Heterogeneous mobile hardwares
  - from hundred to thousand dollar ones
  - less of an issue with iOS, but rather prevelent with android
- Mobile tech evolves rapidly
  - more capable hardware keeps being released
  - software platforms change with time
