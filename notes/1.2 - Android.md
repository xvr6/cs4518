# Android

- Mobile OS
  - Maintained by Google after it was bought from Android INC in 2005
  - Based on linux kernel and java

## Platform Architecture

- system apps
- framework apis in java
- android NDK and runtime
- hardware abstraction layer
- Layers on top of linux kernel: GPLv2

## Overview of Android dev

- XML to specify the UI of an activity
  - ViewGroups provide the abstraction to orchestrate different views
- How to make view widgets to respond to user events
  - each widget (ex: buttons) have a resource ID in the XML
  - create  reference to the widget by going thorough the inflated view hierarchy
  - then implement the appropriate listener interface

### Activity

- Android SDK provides an activity class which you leverage to implement your apps functionality
  - At a high level, you override appropriate lifecycle callbacks, e.g. onCreate(), to allow android to execute your code

### Layout

- android studio provide both code and design video go allow you to specify the set of UI objects and how they appear on screen
  - android sdk provides many widgets (ui objects that the user can see or interact with) like a button
  - a view group can be considered as a special view and its main responsibility is to orchestrate how other view

## UI Thread

- the ui thread also called main thread, handles user interactions and rendering
- activities run on main thread by default  
- if an operation blocks the ui thread, the app may freeze
  - solution: use background threads or co-routines
  - kotlins coroutines provide a way to perform background without blocking the UI thread.
