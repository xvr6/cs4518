## Intro

The document defines mobile computing as the use of computing systems that can be moved easily and used while in motion. Examples include laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones. The distinction between mobile and stationary computing systems is crucial because of differences in their functionality, design, and operation.

Key Characteristics of Mobile Computing:

- Wireless Connectivity: Mobile devices rely on wireless communication rather than wired connections.  
- Portability: These systems are small and lightweight.  
- Battery-Powered Operation: Unlike stationary computers, mobile devices must manage power efficiently.  
- User-Centric Functionality: Mobile applications are designed for users who are on the move.

The author emphasizes that software engineering for mobile applications is still a developing field. While stationary computing systems have well-established methodologies, mobile computing still lacks robust frameworks, tools, and architectures.

## History of Mobile Computing

The document traces the origins of mobile computing, showing how technology evolved:

1. Early Tools  
   The abacus (500 B.C.) is considered one of the first mobile computing devices because of its portability.  
   - Modern calculators evolved from the abacus, retaining small size and computational functionality.

2. Networking and Storage  
   - Before electronic storage, information was recorded manually.  
   - The development of networking in the 1960s allowed computers to communicate, but early networks were wired and unsuitable for mobile devices.

3. Wireless Communication Evolution

   - The 1960s saw the military using wireless technologies for communication.  
   - Satellites in the 1970s improved global wireless communication.  
   - Cellular technology in the 1980s and 1990s allowed for widespread mobile networking.

The transition from wired to wireless networks was critical for mobile computing. However, wired networks still outperform wireless networks in reliability and bandwidth due to physical limitations in electromagnetic communication.

## Is Wireless the Same as Mobile?

The document clarifies that wireless computing and mobile computing are not the same:

- A mobile device does not necessarily require wireless connectivity (e.g., a standalone calculator or a PDA that syncs via a docking station).  
- Wireless communication is simply one means by which mobile devices can connect to a network.

Today, most mobile devices are wireless, but the two concepts remain distinct.

## Key Dimensions of Mobile Computing

Mobile computing differs from traditional computing in several ways. The document introduces seven "dimensions of mobility" that define these differences:

1. Location Awareness  
   - Mobile applications can detect and utilize location data.  
   - Technologies like GPS, cellular triangulation, and Wi-Fi positioning allow location-based services.  
   - Example: A GPS-enabled app that suggests the best route to work based on current traffic conditions.  
2. Network Connectivity & Quality of Service (QoS)  
   - Unlike stationary computers, mobile devices experience intermittent connectivity.  
   - Wireless networks are affected by:  
     - Physical obstructions (e.g., buildings, tunnels).  
     - Weather conditions (e.g., solar flares).  
     - Limited bandwidth and reliability.  
   - Applications must be designed to handle disconnections and fluctuating bandwidth.  
   - Example: A mobile app that resumes downloads automatically when a connection is re-established.  
3. Limited Device Capabilities  
   - Due to size constraints, mobile devices have:  
     - Lower processing power.  
     - Less storage space.  
     - Limited battery life.  
   - Software for mobile devices must be lightweight and optimized.  
   - Example: Cloud-based computing helps offload processing to remote servers.  
4. Power Supply Limitations  
   - Mobile devices depend on battery power, which limits their operation time.  
   - Techniques to extend battery life include:  
     - Efficient power management.  
     - Optimized software that reduces background activity.  
   - Example: Mobile operating systems that adjust screen brightness or disable background apps to conserve power.  
5. Diverse User Interfaces  
   - Unlike traditional computers with keyboards and mice, mobile devices use:  
     - Touchscreens.  
     - Voice recognition.  
     - Gesture controls.  
   - Designing intuitive user interfaces for different input methods is a challenge.  
   - Example: Apps like Google Assistant that use voice recognition.  
6. Platform Proliferation  
   - Mobile devices run on various operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.).  
   - Applications must be developed to be cross-platform compatible.  
   - Example: A mobile banking app must function seamlessly across different operating systems.  
7. Active Transactions in Mobile Applications  
   - Mobile applications often require real-time data synchronization.  
   - Network disruptions can cause transaction failures.  
   - Example: A mobile payment app must handle secure transactions even with unstable network connections.

## Mobile Computing Software Development

Developing mobile applications differs significantly from traditional software engineering due to the constraints mentioned above. The document suggests:

- Use of Unified Modeling Language (UML) for designing mobile applications.  
- Adoption of XML-based architectures to enable flexible data exchange.  
- Leveraging cloud computing to reduce the computational load on mobile devices.

Several platforms are mentioned for mobile app development, including:

- Java (for Android applications).  
- Windows CE (for enterprise mobile solutions).  
- Symbian and Qualcomm BREW (legacy mobile platforms).

## Future Directions in Mobile Computing

The document concludes by outlining key areas for future innovation:

- Better energy-efficient hardware: To extend battery life.  
- Advanced networking solutions: To improve wireless connectivity and reduce data loss.  
- AI-powered mobile applications: To enable smarter, more context-aware computing.

It emphasizes that mobile computing is still evolving, with research focusing on improving user experience, connectivity, and computational efficiency.

## Key Takeaways

- Mobile computing differs fundamentally from stationary computing due to portability, wireless communication, and power constraints.  
- Wireless computing is not the same as mobile computing, though most mobile devices today are wireless.  
- Challenges include network connectivity, limited hardware capabilities, power supply constraints, and user interface diversity.  
- Mobile software development requires new frameworks and methodologies, focusing on lightweight, cross-platform, and adaptive applications.

Discussion with: Cutter Beck, Connor Chartier, Yi Hong Jiang, me, Zen Dignan

- texts were largely outdated
- main points about networking difficulty on mobile devices is very outdated
  - still issues with network connection, but nowhere near as difficult as before
  - much easier to reconnect than before
- Tools to make developing for multiple different device sizes/OSes make dev a lot easier
- Data collection is still a relevant concern
  - Has gotten a lot worse now a days - many more sensors on devices
