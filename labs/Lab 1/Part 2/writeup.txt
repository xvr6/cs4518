Technical writeup 
- project setup / app overview

This app allows users to report a perceived 'criminal intent'. It takes an image, has a title, a boolean value representing I the crime was solved or not, and has a place to link a contact if a suspect is known.

- key feature 1

The first key feature I focused on was the photo taking feature. I wanted to understand how the android api calls worked here to implement it in future apps. With a button press, the user runs a small script that calls the android apis built in camera features. Afterwards, it names the file, saves it, and imports the file to the app.

First, the app is given permission to do so via the android manifest xml. This Is what tells android that the app may request/require the hardware access. 

- key feature 2

This feature is very similar to the first; importing a contact to the app with a button click. This is handled in much the same way - just an API call and some flow handling.

First, just like the first feature, the app is given permission via the manifest xml.
