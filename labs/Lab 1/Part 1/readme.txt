This part was worked on solo:
Mark "Xavier" Bonavita - mlbonavita@wpi.edu

To implement the changes, I added a variable into cheateractivity to store the status. The was then passed around in various different functions to ensure it all worked correctly. To implement the second change ,all that was needed was to add a quick statement into the next button listener to turn cheater status false
