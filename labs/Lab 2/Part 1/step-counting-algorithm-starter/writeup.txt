    1. What are the value ranges for the D1 trace and the D3 trace? 
       1. The value ranges for the x, y, and z axes can be determined by analyzing the raw acceleration data. Typically, the values will range between approximately -10m/s^2 to 10 m/s^2, depending on the phone's orientation and movement. This is the same for D1 and D3
    2. Why do you think the raw accelerometer data reading look different, given that they were collected under very similar conditions?
       1. Phone orientation was most likely the largest factor. D1 was recorded with the left hand and D3 with the right.

    2. Compare the magnitude plots with the previous raw acceleration data plots, and briefly explain why it should be easier to work with the magnitude data.
       1. Orientation Independence: Since the raw acceleration is x,y,z, it would changed drastically based on how the phone was ornenated. Turning this data into a magnitude makes this issue nonexistent. This also leads to simplified analysis, reducing the complexity by 2/3rds.
